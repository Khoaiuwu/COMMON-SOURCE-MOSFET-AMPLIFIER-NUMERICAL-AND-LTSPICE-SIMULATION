# COMMON-SOURCE-MOSFET-AMPLIFIER-NUMERICAL-AND-LTSPICE-SIMULATION
A common-source amplifier is one of three basic single-stage field-effect transistor (FET) amplifier topologies used as a voltage or transconductance amplifier in electronics. The simplest way to determine whether a FET is a common source, common drain, or common gate is to look at where the signal enters and exits.
